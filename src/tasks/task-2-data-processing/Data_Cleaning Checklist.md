- Are there missing values in your data and what is the reason and what you can do about it?
- Is the same value recorded in the same way everywhere?
- Are there any duplicates?
- Is your data unbiased?
- Removed all sources of noise from your data?
- Identified and remove sources of data leakage?
- Are there any obvious outliers?
